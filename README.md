# R_Shiny_US_crime
This project builds an R Shiny app where users can explore the FBI violent crime data from 1975 - 2015 with interactive data visualizations including time series and maps.  
The app was published with shinyapp.io and is available [here]("https://grainneroneill.shinyapps.io/US_crime/").  
The data can be downloaded from [Kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshallproject/crime-rates?resource=download").
